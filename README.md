# Machine-Learning-Assignment-Praxis
The following problem had been assigned as class assignment from Praxis Business School by the Machine Learning department.

In the assignment we have explored the concept of covariance matrix, correlation matrix, eigen-value and eigen-vectors, MLE and Expectation Maximization by a simple coin toss simulation.

A dataset has been used with more than 20k samples and training error and validation error has been compared for the same by tuning 5 different hyperparameters for Random Forest Regressor model. And the same has been plotted.
